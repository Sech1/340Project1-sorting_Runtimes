Open terminal (or command line if you're running Windows) head to the
directory for the unzipped program (Where you unzipped the turn-in file)
You should see main.py and some other python source files.
To run the program simply type:
python main.py

- This assumes you have python installed correctly!

A command-line user interface will guide your through the process of
testing the different algorithms and output the results to a file in
the working directory of the program.
Obviously, python must be installed for this to work correctly.
No external requirements or imports should be required.

All other docs (an excel sheet with all the data collected) as well as
a report .pdf are contained within the docs folder.

PLEASE NOTE:
The excel sheet contains four 'tabs' these can be seen at the bottom of
the window if running in Microsoft Excel.

All sorting algorithms are broken up into classes to maintain everyones
sanity and ease of reading, there is some silly run-on code. It's just the
way it was written to make it easy to run from command-line arguments.
